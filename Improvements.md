# Improvements to Session Management, Email Sending, API Responses, and Websocket Robustness

## What Was Changed

### 1. Session Management
- **Replaced Infinite Busy Loops with Periodic Cleanup:**
  - The original `clear_sessions` and `clear_reset_passwords` methods used infinite `while` loops that ran as fast as possible, causing high CPU usage.
  - These were replaced with `start_periodic_session_cleanup` and `start_periodic_reset_password_cleanup`, which run cleanup every 60 seconds in a background thread.
  - Cleanup logic is now in `clear_sessions_once` and `clear_reset_passwords_once`, called periodically.
- **Consistent OTP Cleanup:**
  - Fixed logic so reset password OTPs are only cleared when expired, not when user is already verified. This prevents premature deletion and ensures password reset works reliably.
- **Updated Server Startup:**
  - In `lifespan`, the server now starts periodic cleanup tasks instead of busy-loop threads.

### 2. Email Sending
- **Per-Email SMTP Connection:**
  - Each email uses a new SMTP connection and login, avoiding issues with stale connections.
- **Background Thread for Sending:**
  - Email sending is done in a background thread, so user requests are never blocked.
- **Removed Persistent Mail Object:**
  - The `_Mail` class and persistent connection logic were removed. All email sending is now per-request and thread-safe.

### 3. API Response Improvements
- **Post API User Info Enrichment:**
  - Post endpoints now return full user info for authors, likers, and commenters, reducing the need for multiple client API calls and improving frontend efficiency.
- **Updated Pydantic Models:**
  - Response models were refactored to support richer user info in post responses.

### 4. Websocket Implementation and Robustness
- **Session/SID Management:**
  - Improved session management to support multiple simultaneous connections per user (multiple SIDs tracked).
- **Notification Delivery:**
  - Websocket connect handler ensures notifications and contacts are sent to all active SIDs for a user.
- **Error Handling and Scalability:**
  - Improved error handling and documented best practices for robust, scalable websocket usage.

## Impact

- **Greatly Reduced CPU Usage:**
  - Server no longer runs tight loops; cleanup is efficient and predictable.
- **Reliable Password Reset:**
  - OTP cleanup logic ensures reset OTPs are only cleared when expired, not prematurely.
- **More Predictable and Scalable:**
  - Session and reset password cleanup are now predictable and tunable.
- **Easier Maintenance:**
  - The new structure is easier to understand and maintain, and can be further improved (e.g., async tasks, external stores).
- **Robust Email Delivery:**
  - Email sending is now robust against connection issues and does not block user requests.
- **Efficient API Responses:**
  - Post endpoints now provide all needed user info in a single call, reducing frontend complexity and server load.
- **Websocket Reliability:**
  - Multiple browser tabs/devices per user are supported, and notifications are delivered reliably.

---

**Summary:**

Session management is now efficient, predictable, and no longer causes high CPU usage. Email sending is robust, non-blocking, and safe for production use. API responses are richer and more efficient, and websocket implementation is more reliable and scalable, supporting multiple connections per user and robust notification delivery.
